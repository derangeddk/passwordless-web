                    <p>
                        You probably have a lot of passwords.
                        You have an email, social media accounts, and websites for professional use.
                        The passwords for each service are not the same &mdash; some sites have different requirements, and you feel safer having different passwords for at least some of the sites.
                        That way, people who get illegal access to your social media can't also read your email and spam your professional networks.
                        But it's a lot to remember.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might have heard that you should use long, random strings as your passwords.
                        There are programs &mdash; password managers &mdash; that make this easier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But you don't actually need separate applications for this.
                        The solution is obvious: you only need access to your email or your phone (or some other mode of contact that is provably yours).
                        You receive a one-time code, and you can enter this code to prove your identity.

                        passwordless identities come with at least one mode of contact - but often more.
                        We have taken care of all the infrastructure, making it super easy to send emails and texts to your users.
